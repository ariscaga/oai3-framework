## Quick Start

### What to Read First

**If you're NEW to OAI³:**
1. Start with `06_CosentriQ_Platform_Architecture.md` - Understand the product and value proposition
2. Then review `04_OAI3_Implementation_Stack.md` - Learn the 5-layer framework
3. Finally explore specific diagrams as needed

**If you're TECHNICAL:**
1. Start with `01_MIA_Orchestration_Flow.md` - Orchestration details
2. Review `05_Complete_System_Integration.md` - How everything connects
3. Dive into individual CAGA/CLAGA diagrams for specifics

**If you're RESEARCHING (Grants, Academic):**
1. Start with `02_CAGA_Network_Architecture.md` - Novel contribution #1
2. Then `03_CLAGA_Adaptation_Flow.md` - Novel contribution #2
3. Use `04_OAI3_Implementation_Stack.md` for framework foundation

## Key Concepts Glossary

**OAI³** (Organizational Ambient Integrated Intelligence)  
The framework that recognizes organizations as intelligent systems and provides infrastructure for coherent AI adoption.

**CosentriQ**  
The first platform built on OAI³ principles, delivering organizational intelligence to non-technical SMEs.

**MIA** (Multifactorial Intelligence Alignment)  
The orchestration layer that coordinates CAGAs and CLAGAs to deliver context-aware intelligence.

**CAGAs** (Context-Aware Growth Agents)  
Seven specialized reasoning engines that analyze organizational context across different domains (Alignment, Human Capacity, Technical, Privacy, Risk, Financial, Opportunity).

**CLAGAs** (Cognitive Load Aware Growth Agents)  
Adaptive agents that detect human cognitive state in real-time and adjust information delivery to prevent overwhelm.

**5 Layers of OAI³**
1. Systems & Workflow Coherence
2. Decision Architecture
3. Infrastructure Readiness
4. Intelligence Integration Logic
5. Evolutionary Capacity

**Organizational Intelligence Maturity Levels**
- Level 0: Fragmented
- Level 1: Mapped (Layer 1 complete)
- Level 2: Clarified (Layer 2 complete)
- Level 3: Ready (Layer 3 complete)
- Level 4: Integrated (Layer 4 complete)
- Level 5: Adaptive (Layer 5 complete)
